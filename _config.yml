  As a Software Engineer, Growth at Upstart, I apply my skills and knowledge in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices, and A/B Testing to improve the user experience and conversion rate of our online lending platform. I have been working at Upstart for four years, and I enjoy being part of a mission-driven, innovative, and collaborative team that is transforming the credit industry with AI and data science.

  Before joining Upstart, I was a Software Engineer at Snapdocs, where I built back-end solutions for connecting our notary scheduling app and our digital closing solution for lenders and designed and implemented a microservice for storing eNotes. I also have two years of experience as an Outcomes Instructor at General Assembly, where I taught algorithms and interview prep to recent graduates of the web development boot camp. My background in mathematics and special education has given me a unique perspective and a strong foundation in problem-solving, communication, and mentorship. I am passionate about creating software that is accessible, user-friendly, and impactful.
